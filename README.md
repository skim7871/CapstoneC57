# Capstone CS57

This project aims to tokenize words and phrases, and measure the relatedness degree of themselves through unsupervised learning from the given text corpus. 

## Background 

With the rapid development of medical information and research, the number of medical literatures also showed explosive growth. However, the different expressions of medical knowledge lead to the redundancy and heterogeneity, and make it difficult to achieve a unified and standardized expression of medical vocabularies. This undoubtedly adds a lot of burden to medical professionals in real-life, especially when reading and screening literatures, that target literatures are often missed due to lack of synonyms or related words.

## Data Description 

Training data consists of 49,579 medical literature on 10 different research topics in the medical domain, including .txt, .net, and .ris files (See the data folder) .net and .txt files are in Chinese and .ris files are in English.

## Expected Output

The output is expected organized as a similarity matrix of all vocabularies. (See example.xlsx)
